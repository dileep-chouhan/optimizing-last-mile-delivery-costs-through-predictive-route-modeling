# Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Costs through Predictive Route Modeling

## Overview

This project aims to reduce last-mile delivery expenses by 15% within six months.  It achieves this by developing a predictive model that optimizes delivery routes in real-time, considering factors such as traffic congestion, weather conditions, and fluctuating demand patterns. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and route optimization using a chosen algorithm (details specified within the code).  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights and route suggestions that minimize delivery time and fuel consumption.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (or specify the specific ML library used)
* [Add any other libraries used, e.g., a routing library like OR-Tools]


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Ensure that the necessary data files (specified in the code) are present in the project directory.


## Example Output

The script generates the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  Printed analysis summarizing key findings, including model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, R-squared) and estimated cost savings.
* **Plot Files:**  Generated visualizations (e.g., `route_optimization.png`, `cost_savings_projection.png`) illustrating optimized routes and projected cost reductions over time.  These files will be saved in the project's directory.
